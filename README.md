### 🚀 About Me
I'm a full-stack web developer who loves building creative tools, smooth user interfaces, and fun digital experiences.
Most of my work revolves around **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **shadcn/ui**, and modern web tooling. I enjoy turning ideas into working prototypes fast, then polishing them into real products.

I’m always experimenting with new technologies, improving my workflow, and exploring ways to make apps feel more responsive and satisfying to use. Recently, I've been focusing on **PIXELART**, a community-driven platform for sharing pixel art, and I'm also developing a personal **Minecraft Clone**, where I’m looking for a developer who wants to collaborate.

If you want to reach out, discuss web development, or contribute to one of my projects, you can always find me on my **Discord server**.
I love connecting with other developers, getting feedback, and building cool things together.
